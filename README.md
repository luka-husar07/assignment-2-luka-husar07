# CAP-5771-s24-assignment-2
Second program assignment.

Due date: April 8, 11:59 pm

# Important: 
- when there is a discrepency between the assignment and 
  the code your given, the code should have preference.
- The code comments are pretty explicit. Sometimes you'll have doubts. Email 
  the TA AND myself to get a reply in the online discussions on Canvas. 
- Executing: `python partx.py` should produce a pkl file. 
- Generate any requested plots and put them in a pdf report. Include this pdf in your repository. 
  Name the pdf:  "assignment2_report_name.pdf" or "assignment2_report_first_lastname". 
  For example, if I was returning my report, I would name the file either: 
  "assignment2_report_erlebacher.pdf" or "assignment2_report_gordon_erlebacher.pdf".
